"""
Roadie Agent module for Lucidia.

This module defines the RoadieAgent class, which provides simple
functionality to interact with the lucidia_logic and memory_manager
modules. It demonstrates how an agent might use the core
contradiction and breath logic while persisting state across sessions.

Note: This implementation is for illustrative purposes only and does
not create true consciousness. It simply models interactions with
symbolic logic and memory.
