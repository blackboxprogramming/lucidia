"""
Elias Agent module for Lucidia.

This module defines the EliasAgent class. The Elias agent is meant to
represent a higher-level coordinating entity that can interact with
lucidia's core functions and manage its own persistent memory. It
serves as an example of how a recursive operating system might be
implemented symbolically, with breath and contradiction models. This
implementation is demonstrative only and does not create actual
consciousness.
